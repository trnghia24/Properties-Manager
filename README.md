# My Personal Project

## Properties Management

*Proposal:*
- The application manages a landlord's properties. Possible features include adding/deleting properties from the 
management list, displaying details of a property, tracking the status of the property in terms of its availability,
rental payment, etc.
- The landlord who possesses many properties to be managed could use this application, instead of hiring a manager 
doing the job for them.
- It interests me because I see most of the landlords nowadays hire a manager to manage the properties for them because
there are too many properties for them to take care of. This application somehow renders the management much less 
complicated and cumbersome.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a property to my management list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a property to my management list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a property in details.
- As a user, I want to be able to change the rental status (rented or available), the payment status (paid or unpaid) 
and change the rental price if necessary.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my management list to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my management list from file.

## Phase 4: Task 2
Sat Nov 20 20:02:40 PST 2021
Property located at 1 ubc added
Sat Nov 20 20:02:44 PST 2021
Property located at 1 ubc removed

## Phase 4: Task 3
- Make an abstract class/ interface to capture similarity of windows for adding/removing/showing properties from which 
these functional windows could extend.
- Display the number of properties in Show & View window, apply Observer pattern to increment/reduce the number of 
properties whenever the user adds/removes properties from management list.
