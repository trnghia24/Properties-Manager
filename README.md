# My Personal Project

## A subtitle

A *bulleted* list:
- The application keeps track of eateries, remove those from the application if closed down, updates newly opened stores. 
Possible features such as different categories of eateries, listing those based on open/closed hours, dining styles,
ratings, etc. and plan the meal trips based on specific filters . Visualizations of food photos, leaderboard based on ratings.
- This application is designed for those who always wants to grab a good bite but with limited resources to get recommendations.
- This project interests me because I usually find myself on food tours but being confused regarding where to eat.
Applications for food review on the market today doesn't have meal planner which I think a necessary feature to have.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
