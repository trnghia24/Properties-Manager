# My Personal Project

## A subtitle

A *bulleted* list:
- The application manages a landlord's properties. Possible features include changing the rental fee visualizations of 
rented, available-for-rent properties, or showing if properties' tenants paid their rent.
- The landlord who possesses many properties to be managed could use this application, instead of hiring a manager doing
the job for them.
- It interests me because I see most of the landlords nowadays hire a manager to manage the properties for them because
there are too many properties for them to take care of. This application somehow renders the management less complicated
and cumbersome.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a property to my management list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a property to my management list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a property in details.
- As a user, I want to be able to change the rental status (rented or available), the payment status (paid or unpaid) 
and change the rental price if necessary.

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
